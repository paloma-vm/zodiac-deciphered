I used masking to cut out Zodiac characters to make a custom 404 page graphic.

The first main blocker I encountered was broken image links.  I did research and found out how to make a static folder and then changed all the links.

I needed help from Mitchell to get the flask poll running and connected to the database.

I did not get to the point of deployment.  I will have to learn how to deploy a flask app.

After the pitch, I removed the /poll page and restored the poll to the homepage.

I learned a lot and did a lot of research during this Intensive.  I was inspired by Kash's workshop to do data visualization timeline in the future.
